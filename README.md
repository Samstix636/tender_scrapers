# tender_scrapers

This project scrapes tender details from various websites including, tenderdetail.com, tendertiger.com, bidassist.com and others.
The scrapers are built using a combination of scrapy and selenium.

# HOW TO RUN THE SPIDER
Clone the project to your computer.

Make sure you have python version 3 or greater installed.

pip install scrapy and selenium

From the directory where you have the scrapy.cfg file, open your terminal and use the command "scrapy crawl spider_name -o output_filename.csv"

Do not forget to replace "spider_name" with the actual name of the spider you want to run.

Enjoy.
